## About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University.  My research focuses on medical image reconstruction and image quality evaluation. More recently I have been working on combining machine learning methods and model based image reconstruction to improve diagnosis.


### Research interest

- Inverse problems, image reconstruction in SPECT, PET, and x-ray CT
- Machine learning for medical imaging applications

### Recent works
